Notes:

Since the only sample workouts we have drawn up at this point were all beginner workouts, and I didn't want to structure a bunch of random workouts without talking to you guys,
I just made it so we have 1 of each difficulty (changed the difficulty of some of the beginner workouts).  I just gauged it subjectively.  
I figure we can talk about all the details and make necessary changes, but this way we at least can have
something in the database if we need to present to the class.

Duration attribute removed from EXERCISE table since I'm not sure 
how to input a range like "10-15 mins" as an attribute.  For now, the
duration attribute is only in the WORKOUT table.  I figure we can calculate it somehow in the front end code.

For the ranges of reps like "8-10", I just used the higher number. Again, I'm not sure how to implement a range as an attribute.  

I guess we could add another attribute to the table, so there is like a "high" and a "low" for any attribute that needs a range.  We can discuss tomorrow.
